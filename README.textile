Kookaburra-Server simple open source IRCD written in Ruby.

It's a fork of "ruby-ircd":http://code.google.com/p/ruby-ircd/ with 
some new work done (note: I'm moving towards rewriting everything).

h2. Features

# Better layout - proper module hierarchy
# DRB interface
# a catch all channel
# A proper logger
# proper option support
# settings via configatron
# Uses eventmachine for the networking

h2. Usage

To use, try:

  sudo gem install eventmachine extlib configatron
  ./script/server

h2. Todo

# Tests tests tests!
# Massive refactoring / clean up of the code
# Extensive testing
# Ninjas!
# less-hacked together interface
# Move towards Marvin-esque handlers / events system
# Oh, did I mention tests?

Kudos!
