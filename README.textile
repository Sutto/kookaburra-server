Kookaburra is an simple open source IRCD written in Ruby.

It's a fork of "ruby-ircd":http://code.google.com/p/ruby-ircd/ with the following
new features:

# Better layout - proper module hierarchy
# DRB interface
# a catch all channel
# A proper logger
# proper option support
# settings via configatron

To use, try:

  sudo gem install eventmachine extlib configatron
  ./script/server

Kudos!
